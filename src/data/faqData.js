        "How long does the entire design and development process take?",
        "Our websites typically take between 4-8 weeks to complete. Development timelines can vary depending on the package selected and how quickly clients respond to content requests and proposal feedback.",
      ],
      [
        "What is the difference between the Whole Package and Membership Package?",
        "The main difference is long term versus short term costs. Our Membership Package will cost more over time, but you'll pay small manageable and affordable monthly payments. The Whole Package is a one-time payment that covers the entire project. When deciding which package is best for you, it all depends on your budget and services included in each package.",
      ],
      [
        "How do I make a payment and what payment methods do you accept?",
        "We will send you and invoice via Square that provides you a link to the secure payment page. Memberships can be paid with a credit card or debit card. Whole Package projects are paid with an ACH bank transfer. We DO NOT ACCEPT CHECKS.",
      ],
      [
        "Do you offer refunds?",
        "When you sign a contract (whole package or membership package) a deposit is required before designing begins. If you are not satisfied with our design proposals and no longer wish to continue with us, then we will refund you your deposit.",
      ],
      [
        "Who owns the domain name and website after the project is completed?",
        "Purchasing the domain is included in all of our packages but the CLIENT will always own the domain name. The website is owned by the GCWDD unless the client chooses the Whole or E-commerce Package. If the client is on a Membership plan and cancels, the website will be taken down and the client will no longer have access to it.",
      ],
      [
        "How do we request edits?",
        "All edit requests must be submitted via email to <a href='mailto:GulfCoastWDD@protonmail.com' class='email-link'>GulfCoastWDD@protonmail.com</a> and will be fulfilled in the order they're received. As edits are received and completed, we will send you an email notification.",

    Membership: [
      [
        "How long does Membership subscription last?",
        "Membership subscription plans last a minimum of 12 months. After the 12 months, it is on a month-to-month basis and you can cancel at any time. If you cancel, you do not keep the site.",
      ],
      [
        "If I previously cancelled, can I re-subscribe?",
        "Yes! You just have to sign a new 12 month contract.",

      ],
      [
        "How do you handle late payments?",
        "Every invoice sent comes with a 7 day grace period. If the invoice is not paid within those 7 days, there will be a $25 late fee applied. If you're on a Membership subscription, and there are multiple invoices that are overdue, we can cancel the contract and the client will be responsible for paying the full price of the site. We are generally very flexible and understanding of certain situations and often times offer assistance and help. We recommend setting up automatic payments to avoid this issue.",
